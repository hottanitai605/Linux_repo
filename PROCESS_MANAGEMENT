>> PROCESS_MANAGEMENT: 
  ===================

Q> What is a Process?

 Ans: An running  instance of a program is called a Process.
      In simple terms, any command that you give to your Linux machine starts a new process.
	  
	  
Types of Processes:

>> Foreground Processes: 
    > By default, every process that you start runs in the foreground. 
	  It gets its input from the keyboard and sends its output to the screen.

    > You can see this happen with the ls command. 
	  If you wish to list all the files in your current directory, 
	  you can use the following command âˆ’

Background Processes: 

  >> A background process runs without being connected to your keyboard.
     If the background process requires any keyboard input, it waits.


   > The advantage of running a process in the background is that you can run other commands;
     you do not have to wait until it completes to start another!

   > The simplest way to start a background process is to add an ampersand (&) at the end of the command.
